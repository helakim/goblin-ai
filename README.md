## Start Day: Tuesday, 24 September 2019

## Introduction
1. Goblin AI is a library of deep learning models and datasets designed to make deep learning more accessible

2. The ultimate goal of SEMI-AutoDL is to provide easily accessible deep learning tools to domain experts with limited data science or machine learning background

3. Supported Ai-Goblin provides the visualization and tooling needed for Deep Learning experimentation (with VisDom)

4. Supported Experiment with various deep learning methods using the JupyterLabs

5. Each of the Deep Learning models is independent and simple to apply to the application

6. [Using the ai-hub data :)](http://www.aihub.or.kr/) 

7. Korean documents will be added later
